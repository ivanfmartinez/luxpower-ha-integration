A comprehensive Home Assistant integration to monitor and control LuxPower inverters via their Modbus TCP interface.

This integration connects directly to your inverter's WiFi dongle, providing real-time data and control over various settings without relying on the cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> **Version 0.2.0 introduces Device Grouping** - a major organizational improvement that groups your 250+ entities into logical sub-devices (PV, Grid, EPS, Generator, Battery, Temperatures & Diagnostics, Settings & Schedules) for much better navigation in Home Assistant. See the [Device Grouping section](#device-grouping-available-since-v020) below for details.

## Features

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Track PV power, battery state of charge (SOC), grid import/export, load consumption, and more.
* **Inverter Control:** Change charge/discharge currents, set timed charging/discharging periods, and enable/disable features like grid feed-in.
* **Organized Device Structure:** (v0.2.0+) Entities are automatically grouped into logical sub-devices (PV, Grid, EPS, Generator, Battery, Temperatures & Diagnostics, Settings & Schedules) for better organization in Home Assistant.
* **Detailed States:** A user-friendly text sensor shows exactly what the inverter is doing (e.g., "PV Powering Load & Charging Battery").
* **Calculated Sensors:** Includes derived sensors like "Load Percentage" for a clearer view of your system's performance.
* **Local Polling:** All communication is local. No cloud dependency.

### Prerequisites

Your LuxPower inverter's WiFi data logging dongle must be connected to the same local network as your Home Assistant instance. You will need to know its IP address.

### HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)

This integration is available in the default HACS repository.

1.  Navigate to **HACS** > **Integrations** in your Home Assistant instance.
2.  Click the **Explore & Download Repositories** button.
3.  Search for "Luxpower Inverter (Modbus)" and click **"Download"**.
4.  Restart Home Assistant when prompted.

### Manual Installation

1.  Copy the `lxp_modbus` folder from this repository into your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
2.  Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Configuration is done entirely through the Home Assistant UI.

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2.  Click **Add Integration** and search for **"Luxpower Inverter (Modbus)"**.
3.  Fill in the required details for your inverter.

### Configuration Options

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IP Address** | string | **(Required)** The IP address of your inverter's WiFi dongle. |
| **Port** | integer | **(Required)** The communication port for the Modbus connection, typically `8000`. |
| **Dongle Serial Number**| string | **(Required)** The 10-character serial number of your WiFi dongle. |
| **Inverter Serial Number**| string | **(Required)** The 10-character serial number of your inverter. |
| **Polling Interval** | integer | **(Required)** How often (in seconds) to poll the inverter for data. Default is 60. |
| **Inverter Rated Power**| integer | **(Required)** The rated power of your inverter in Watts (e.g., `5000` for a 5kW model). |
| **Entity Prefix** | string | (Optional) A custom prefix for all entity names (e.g., 'LXP'). Leave blank for no prefix. |
| **Read-Only Mode** | boolean| (Optional) See the important warning below before changing this setting. |
| **Register Block Size** | integer | (Optional) Size of register blocks to read. Use `125` (default) for most inverters, use `40` for older firmware versions that don't support larger blocks. |
| **Connection Retry Attempts** | integer | Number of connection retry attempts before giving up (default is 3). |
| **Enable Device Grouping** | boolean | (v0.2.0+) Group entities into logical sub-devices for better organization (default: enabled). |
| **Battery entities** | String | (v0.2.?+) Create individual battery entities per battery found, can be 'auto','none'(default) or specific battery serial numbers separated by comma. |

> [!WARNING]
> ### Important Note on Read-Only Mode (Available since v0.1.5)
>
> The **Read-Only Mode** setting fundamentally changes the type of entities this integration creates for inverter controls.
>
> * **If `Read-Only Mode` is OFF (default):** The integration will create interactive entities like `number`, `switch`, and `select` to allow you to control your inverter.
> * **If `Read-Only Mode` is ON:** All of those control entities will instead be created as read-only `sensor` entities. You will be able to see the current settings, but you will not be able to change them.
>
> **Please choose this setting carefully during the initial setup.** Changing this option later by reconfiguring the integration will **delete** your existing control entities and create new `sensor` entities (or vice-versa). This will break any dashboards, automations, or history that relied on the old entities.

> [!TIP]
> ### Register Block Size Configuration
>
> The **Register Block Size** option allows you to adjust how the integration communicates with your inverter:
>
> * **125** (Default): Use for most modern inverter firmware versions for optimal performance.
> * **40**: Use if you have an older inverter firmware that doesn't support larger register block reads.
>
> If you experience communication errors with the default setting, try switching to the smaller block size.

> [!TIP]
> ### Reconnection Logic & Reliability
>
> This integration includes advanced reconnection logic to handle temporary network or inverter communication issues:
>
> * **Connection Retry Attempts**: Configure how many immediate retry attempts the integration makes when connection fails (default: 3).
> * **Automatic Recovery**: If connection is lost, the integration will temporarily use cached data while attempting to reconnect.
> * **Adaptive Polling**: During recovery mode, the polling frequency automatically adjusts to find the optimal balance between quick reconnection and network load.
> * **Graceful Degradation**: Entities remain available with last known good values during brief connection interruptions.
>
> These features ensure that temporary network issues don't cause your automations to fail or entities to show as unavailable.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Device Grouping (Available since v0.2.0)
>
> Starting with version 0.2.0, this integration introduces **Device Grouping** to better organize the 250+ entities created by your inverter:
>
> * **PV Group** (25 entities): Solar panel monitoring and MPPT controls
> * **Grid Group** (42 entities): Utility grid connection and import/export data
> * **EPS Group** (18 entities): Emergency Power Supply / backup load outputs
> * **Generator Group** (12 entities): Backup generator monitoring and controls
> * **Battery Group** (62 entities): BMS data, cell voltages, temperatures, and battery controls
> * **Battery SERIAL Group** (20 entities): per battery BMS data, cell voltages, temperatures, created when Battery Entities configured
> * **Temperatures & Diagnostics** (12 entities): Temperature sensors, fault codes, and diagnostic data
> * **Settings & Schedules** (56 entities): Configuration settings, timing schedules, and power management
>
> **Configuration Options:**
> * **Enabled by default** for new installations - provides much better organization in Home Assistant
> * **Optional** - can be disabled in integration settings if you prefer all entities under one device
> * **Configurable** - can be toggled on/off at any time through the integration options
>
> **For Existing Users:** When updating to v0.2.0+, device grouping will be automatically enabled. If you prefer the old single-device layout, you can disable it in the integration settings.

### Available Blueprints

#### Force Charge for a Specific Duration
This script blueprint allows you to temporarily force the inverter to charge from the grid for a set amount of time. It saves your existing settings, applies the temporary charge schedule, and restores your settings when finished.

> Manual Import URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ant0nkr/luxpower-ha-integration/main/blueprints/script/lxp_force_charge.yaml`

#### Force Charge to a Target SOC
This automation blueprint allows you to charge your inverter's battery from the AC grid until it reaches a specific State of Charge (SOC) percentage. It automatically saves a snapshot of your current inverter settings before starting and perfectly restores them once the target SOC is met.
